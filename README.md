# Next.js Dynamic Route Data Fetching Error Handling
This example demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications involving dynamic routes and data fetching. When fetching data based on a route parameter (e.g., a post ID),  inadequate error handling can result in unexpected behavior. This repository showcases the problem and its solution.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file shows an implementation where `getServerSideProps` does not correctly handle the case when the requested data is not found. This could lead to a blank page or a confusing client-side error.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides an improved implementation. It includes proper error handling to return a 404 status code when the data is not available, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nextjs-data-fetching-error`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

To observe the error, try accessing a non-existent post ID in the URL, like `/post/12345` (assuming your data doesn't contain post with ID 12345).
