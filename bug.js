In Next.js, a common yet often subtle issue arises when dealing with dynamic routes and data fetching.  Consider a scenario where you have a page at `/post/[id]` that fetches data based on the `id` parameter.  If the `id` is not found (e.g., the post doesn't exist), a typical `getServerSideProps` function might return an error. However, the error handling within Next.js might not be immediately apparent, leading to unexpected behavior like blank pages or cryptic error messages in the browser console rather than a user-friendly 404 page.
